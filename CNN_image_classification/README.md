This project creates a CNN network based on Keras to classify 4 figures on images. Since the training dataset is too small, I did data augmentation with shifting, rotation, zca_whitening, and so on to increase the images on the dataset. The model also was added dropout layers, batch normalization, and L2 regularization.
