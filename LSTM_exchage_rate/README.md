This is a LSTM model based on Keras to predict the currency exchange rate. The dataset was collected from 1/31/1990 to 6/30/2017. In this project, a simple regression model and a simple average model was also built to compare with the LSTM model. 

The model uses the previous 48 months input data to predict the next 48 months currency exchange rate. The best prediction, worst prediction and future prediction are the following image shows:
